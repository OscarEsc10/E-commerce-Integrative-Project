# 404 Found â€“ A Movement for Deep Reading  

Good afternoon. My name is **Oscar**, and I am part of a group called **404 Found**.

## A Question for You  
When was the last time you read a book that really changed how you think or feel?  

---

## The Problem  
Today, life is very fast. We use phones, social media, and short texts every day. But many people donâ€™t read deeply anymore.  

Reading is not only about information â€” it is about **ideas, emotions, and learning**. Sadly, this value is being lost.  

---

## Our Project  
That is why **404 Found** has a project. We want to **promote ebooks in a new way**.  

Our idea is not just to sell ebooks, but to help people **enjoy reading again â€” as an art, not a boring task**.  

With ebooks, you can read anywhere, anytime. But our focus is not fast reading; it is **deep reading**.  

When you read with care, you connect with:  
- Ideas  
- Knowledge  
- Yourself

## Our Value  
With **404 Found ebooks**, you donâ€™t waste time with empty content.  

You focus on good books that:  
- Inspire you  
- Help you grow  
- Create a culture of better reading in families, schools, and communities

## A Movement  
That is why **404 Found** is more than a project â€” **it is a movement**.  

Reading is powerful.

## Final Question  
So I ask you:  
ðŸ‘‰ **Are you ready to support 404 Found and read not only with your eyes, but also with your heart and your mind?**
