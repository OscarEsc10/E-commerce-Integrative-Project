## Elevator Pitch.

Hello everyone, my name is Oscar, and I am very excited to present our project: 404 Found.

404 Found is a modern e-commerce platform for e-books. Today, many readers want fast and simple access to books. With our platform, they can search, buy, and download an e-book instantly, without waiting for shipping or physical delivery.

At the same time, 404 Found is also a solution for writers. Many new authors donâ€™t have the chance to publish their work easily. Our platform gives them a space to share their stories, knowledge, and creativity with a global audience.

What makes 404 Found different is that it is more than just a store. It is a digital community that connects readers and authors in one place. Readers discover new voices, and writers reach new readers.
